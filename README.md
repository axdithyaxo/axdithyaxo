# Hi, I’m Aadithya Vishnu Sajeev

I’m a Master’s graduate in Data Analytics at Dublin City University with a strong focus on AI, NLP, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.  
My work blends machine learning, AI safety, and systems engineering to build privacy-preserving, production-grade AI applications.

## What I Do
- Design and build local, private RAG pipelines integrating SQL, semantic search, and LLMs  
- Develop modular MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for enterprise AI agents  
- Research AI safety, alignment, and fine-tuning techniques (LoRA, PEFT)  
- Work on machine learning models for performance prediction, time-series forecasting, and sentiment analysis  

## Currently Learning
- Advanced multi-modal AI pipelines  
- Efficient fine-tuning of large language models  
- Scalable vector search and hybrid retrieval architectures  

## Collaboration Interests
- AI & NLP product development  
- AI safety and alignment research  
- Consulting on AI system design and deployment
