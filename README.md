## Hi, I’m Aadithya Vishnu Sajeev

- **Author** & **Lead Maintainer** of **[Lár](https://github.com/snath-ai/lar)**, an open-source `Glass-Box` Agent Engine for deterministic AI orchestration.

- I’m a Master’s graduate in Data Analytics at Dublin City University, specializing in AI systems engineering, graph-based agent architectures, and the safe deployment of LLMs.

- My focus is on **infrastructure-as-code for agents**: building open tools that simplify development, increase transparency, and help engineers debug complex reasoning loops.


---

## What I Do

- Authored and Maintain **[Lár](https://github.com/snath-ai/lar)** — an open-source, `Apache-2.0` execution engine that brings "PyTorch-style" define-by-run logic to AI agents.

- Design **auditable, debuggable architectures** that replace "black box" complexity with transparent state machines.

- Develop modular **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** servers for enterprise-grade tool integration.

- Build **Privacy-First RAG pipelines** utilizing FAISS, PostgreSQL, and local semantic search for sensitive data environments.

- Research **Safe Agentic Systems**, focusing on determinism, error recovery, and self-correcting workflows.

## What I'm Learning & Building Toward

- **Graph Theory** applied to Multi-Agent orchestration

- **Synthetic Evaluation** & Automated Error-Detection pipelines

- **Embedded LLMs** for biomedical and high-compliance systems

- **State Management** patterns for long-running, resilient agents


---

## Collaboration Interests

- Open Source AI Infrastructure

- AI Safety & Model Interpretability

- Developer Tooling (Debuggers, SDKs, Tracing)

- Applied AI in Scientific & Research Domains

## Open Source Projects

1. ### **[Lár Engine](https://github.com/snath-ai/lar)** — The Glass-Box Agent Framework (Apache-2.0)
   - A deterministic, graph-based engine for building verifiable agents.
   - Features: Full state introspection, step-by-step replayability, and zero abstraction leaks.

2. ### **Lár Debugger & Visualizer**
   - A developer tool for inspecting agent decision paths.
   - Provides interactive state diffs and execution traces to debug logic failures in real-time.

3. ### **ZenithTech RAG Toolkit**
   - A local, fully private retrieval system using FAISS and PostgreSQL.

4. ### **MCP Forensic Toolkit**
   - An AI-integrated forensic analyzer for log triage and anomaly detection.

## Core Philosophy

I believe the next generation of AI tools must be **interpretable, deterministic, and reliable**. I build open-source infrastructure like **Lár** to help developers move from "magic" prototypes to engineering-grade systems.
