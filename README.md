## Hi, I’m Aadithya Vishnu Sajeev

- Co-founder and CTO @ **[SnathAI](https://github.com/snath-ai)** and co-author of the **[Lár Framework](https://github.com/snath-ai/lar)**, the open-source `Glass-Box` Agent Engine

- I’m a Master’s graduate in Data Analytics at Dublin City University, working at the intersection of AI systems engineering, agent architectures, and safe deployment of LLMs in production environments.

- I build tools and frameworks that simplify AI development, increase transparency, and help developers deploy reliable, auditable agents at scale.


---

## What I Do

- Co-founded **`SnathAI`** , where we are building **`Lár`** — an open-source, `Apache-2.0` “glass box” execution engine for LLM agents.

- Design auditable, debuggable agent frameworks that remove the complexity of LangChain-style black boxes.

- Lead development of modular MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for enterprise-grade AI workflows.

- Build local, privacy-preserving RAG pipelines integrating FAISS, PostgreSQL, semantic search, and tool-augmented LLM reasoning.

- Research and prototype safe agentic systems, fine-tuning (LoRA/PEFT), and self-correcting LLM workflows.



---

## What I'm Learning & Building Toward

- Multi-agent architectures with real-time introspection

- Synthetic evaluation, error-detection pipelines, and agent observability

- Efficient specialization of LLMs for biomedical, enterprise, and embedded systems

- Reinforcement-driven self-correcting agents

- Dynamically composable AI pipelines for production workloads



---

## Collaboration Interests

- AI agents & multi-agent system design

- AI safety, model interpretability, and robust evaluation

- Developer tooling (frameworks, SDKs, agent debuggers)

- Applied AI in biomedical and scientific research

## Projects

1. ### **[Lár](https://github.com/snath-ai/lar)** — The Glass-Box Agent Engine (Apache-2.0)

- An open-source, PyTorch-style engine for agent reasoning.
Deterministic, verifiable, introspectable execution. Zero black boxes.

2. ### **[SnathAI Platform](https://github.com/snath-ai/lar)**

- A developer-first agent debugging and observability layer built on top of Lár.
Interactive state diffs, execution traces, and reproducible agent runs.

3. ### ZenithTech RAG Toolkit

- A local, fully private retrieval system using FAISS, PostgreSQL, and MCP tooling.

4. ### MCP Forensic Toolkit

- A secure AI-integrated forensic analyzer for log triage and anomaly detection.

## Core

I believe AGI-era developer tools should be interpretable, reliable, and open-source — and I’m building SnathAI and Lár to make that future possible.
