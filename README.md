Hi, I’m Aadithya Vishnu Sajeev

I’m a Master’s graduate in Secure Software Engineering at Dublin City University with a strong focus on AI, NLP, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
My work blends machine learning, AI safety, and systems engineering to build privacy-preserving, production-grade AI applications.

What I Do
	•	Design and build local, private RAG pipelines integrating SQL, semantic search, and LLMs
	•	Develop modular MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for enterprise AI agents
	•	Research AI safety, alignment, and fine-tuning techniques (LoRA, PEFT)
	•	Work on machine learning models for performance prediction, time-series forecasting, and sentiment analysis

Currently Learning
	•	Advanced multi-modal AI pipelines
	•	Efficient fine-tuning of large language models
	•	Scalable vector search and hybrid retrieval architectures

Collaboration Interests
	•	AI & NLP product development
	•	AI safety and alignment research
	•	Consulting on AI system design and deployment

Selected Projects
	•	ZenithTech RAG Toolkit – Local, open-source RAG system with FAISS, PostgreSQL, and Claude MCP integration
	•	MCP Forensic Toolkit – Secure AI-integrated MCP server for log triage and forensic analysis

Fun Fact

I believe Generative AI is a turning point in computing history — and I’m building to make it safer, smarter, and more accessible.
